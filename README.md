Timetable for a given section of a semester must contain details about the subjects taught hourly during the days of a week and the faculty members assigned to each subject. Timetables must be such that no two subjects taught by a single lecturer overlap.The problem of timetable scheduling is described as a highly-constrained NP-hard problem. It is known as the timetabling problem by most researchers. A lot of complex constraints need to be addressed for development of an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. Presently, in many institutions, the faculty in-charge has to manually assign hourly slots to every subject while satisfying various constraints. If an overlap/clash is found among the timetable, changes must be made manually using trial and error methods. This tends to take a considerable amount of time and is therefore, inefficient. With the help of software, this process can be simplified, thus reducing time spent and increasing efficiency. Various algorithms have been developed which provide faster techniques to generate timetables. Using suitable programming and database technologies, we can implement these algorithms to obtain results from the inputs given by the user. This also simplifies error correction and future modification, thus aiding maintenance and usability.

Timetable Generator is a desktop application that is a simple and efficient way of generating a timetable for a university. This is a software designed and developed by Nihal Rao, Sanjan Poojari and Shishir Upadhya, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, students of NMAM Institute of Technology, Nitte which is in the state of Karnataka in India. The software is developed using Python 3 for the backend and QT for the GUI. Additionally, packages like PyQt5 and xlrd have been used. An algorithm was developed to satisfy the Educational model setup at NMAMIT. Universities/Colleges that come under Visvesvaraya Technological University(VTU) may also be able to use this with certain modifications and adjustments. This software was developed as major project during the final year of engineering. It was developed under the guidance of Mr. Ramesha Shettigar, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, NMAMIT. The objective of this project was to solve the real life problem of timetable scheduling and generate a timetable without manual effort using the proposed algorithm. The project provides a helping hand to our department and can be widened to be used by other departments and can also be extended to be used for use by University. It has achieved the goals we had set out to accomplish and generates satisfactory timetable schedules for both students and faculty.
