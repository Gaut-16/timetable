bugs and stuff:

elective group combo box.
elective input textboxes lack Enter key link.
elective group shows the last option as Elective-2(rest remain elective-1) when the spinbox is cycled down.
elective combobox and spinbox dont update when sem combo changes.
after resetting, list only populates after setting spinbox and combobox again.

in window 1 , faculty is sorted in list initially, but isnt sorted when faculty is chosen again in input combobox.

clicking generate crashes with "max() arg is an empty sequence" error.
buttons and few widgets need to be cleared after clicking,i.e., they stay selected.

need to add confirming dialog box on closing with X button/File->Exit.

better run program with an .exe file.

**
i feel if list widget displays all values entered for all combobox options, then the adding and editing experience would be more natural , 
i.e., user enters new value - changes semester/section/elective group - adds more value which is shown in list with all entered values sorted - user clicks one list item and edits - clicks reset to clear widgets - continues the entry process.
