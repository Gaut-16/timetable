bugs and stuff:

elective group combo box.
elective form has no input when saved file is loaded, need a new and proper set of inputs for EXPRO!
after resetting, list only populates after setting spinbox and combobox again.(feature, not bug)

in window 1 , faculty is sorted in list initially, but isnt sorted when faculty is chosen again in input combobox.

clicking generate crashes with "max() arg is an empty sequence" error.

need to add confirming dialog box on closing with X button.

better run program with an .exe file.

**
i feel if list widget displays all values entered for all combobox options, then the adding and editing experience would be more natural , 
i.e., user enters new value - changes semester/section/elective group - adds more value which is shown in list with all entered values sorted - user clicks one list item and edits - clicks reset to clear widgets - continues the entry process.

what happens when you delete data in form1 that is used in later forms
clear fixed slots in form3/4
